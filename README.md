# Notas Retailer garbarino
## Crawler
 * Change notes:
     * Retailer seems to have gone through many changes. Result count, products and their data are now retrieved from different elements than before.
     * Crawler is now hybrid, as no meaningful data can only be retrieved from the product page except for stock.
     * No product variants seem to exist in the site, nor any trace of the API calls previously used to retrieve their data. Even products of the same model but with a different accesory seem to be treated as completely separate.
     * No sign of the product ID format previously used can be found. Now using product url (minus domain).
     * No meaningful IDs can be found inside or outside the product pages except for the ones occasionally on the product's name.
     * Detecting 0 products no longer throws an error.
